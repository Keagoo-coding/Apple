The code cycles through one another until it reaches back to the first file where the process repeats.
Every page contains a hyperlink which takes the user to the next page. Hyperlinks are mostly images of apples.
The first page resembles a logo with an apple in the middle which contains a hyperlink to the next page which
shows a GIF related to it and a hyperlink image which proceeds to a page with a different "apple".
